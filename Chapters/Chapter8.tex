After the literature review, \hyperref[Chapter6]{Chapter 6} presented the major differences between a Univerity-Industry and a Business-to-Business approach to the technology transfer. The previous \hyperref[Chapter7]{Chapter 7}, instead, reported the significant case of a private research organization, including the analysis of its organizational structure, processes, and performance. Bearing in mind the theoretical differences and the real-world phenomenon, this chapter will initially discuss the case study, by highlighting three major positive and negative arguments. Lastly, the chapter will draw the final conclusions, extending the case discussion to a fully private environment.

\section{Case study discussion}

The previous chapter exposed the case study of the Bruno Kessler Foundation, highlighting the main organizational structure, the Technology Transfer Office, research products, and the transfer processes. This section will provide a qualitative evaluation of the FBK overall administration, management, and performances, focussing in the areas in which the Foundation excels (the pros), and the weakness of their business model (the cons).

\subsection{Pros}

By all means, the most evident and positive result of FBK is the research performance. As seen in \hyperref[Chapter6]{Chapter 6}, the social network analysis of the European network of innovation shown a significant and positive performance, easily framing the institution as one of the top 200 research organizations participating in FP7 projects, even considering the competition from research centers of national and European levels. According to \hyperref[Chapter2]{Chapter 2} and following the \hyperref[Chapter6]{Chapter 6}, the source of the positive performance can be traced back to two main factors.

The first, and most obvious, is the quality of the human resources employed. The performance level heavily relies on the competencies and skills of the researchers, their personal networks, and reputation. Eventually, the organizational success can be seen in the efficacy of the scouting and selection process, among which stands out the ability to attract new researchers. This may constitute one of the most significant and defendable competitive advantages of the organization. 

The second factor refers instead to the ability of the Foundation, in its entirety, to build an organizational environment and culture that actively support these researchers in achieving their best performance. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the organizational structure, hierarchy, reward and promotion policies and alike is, in fact, positive. However, should be noted immediately that the organizational factors that foster the research performance may influence negatively transfer and commercial activities.

Another positive result that should be highlighted is the impact of the institution on its local context, through various modalities. The first and most evident is the impact of a highly skilled workforce, the creative class of \citet{Florida2002}. Effects range between informal and involuntary knowledge spillovers, attractiveness for other valuable human resources, higher payroll and their impact on the local economy. 

A second element of local impact is the number of spinoffs generated over time. Specifically, FBK spinned 17 new ventures in the last decade, each of them exploiting internal research.\footnote{The list can be found at \hyperref[https://techtransfer.fbk.eu/startup/]{techtransfer.fbk.eu/startup}}
Again, the spinoff impact can be evaluated in a number of mechanisms: the diffusion of technologies in the industry first and the market later, the knowledge impact on the local context, the number of employees, financial flows brought to the Trentino economy, the ability to attract external companies or furthering the economic performance of pre-existent local firms. 

As the research performance, also the spinoff performance should be considered positive, since the Foundation outperforms many Italian public universities and research centers. However, the quantitative economic assessment of their impact is not currently available, nor a comprehensive evaluation model has been developed, and further studies should be performed on the topic.

A third area in which the Foundation excels is in balancing three levels of networking activities: local, national and international. Firstly, an example can be extracted directly from the data on the various contracts that FBK signed with companies and research organizations. Among the first 53th partners, selected by monetary value of the relationships are:

\begin{itemize}

\item In the local context: Optoele srl, inftn spa, spaziodati srl, st micro, pervoice spa, advansid, fem, apss, muse, caritro, create net, eit ict, tnrise, unitn, Istituto marconi

\item In the national context: SunEdison, EII spa, envipark spa, rf micro srl, thales group, mae, lfoundry srl, telecom, cariplo, INFN, CNR, unipd, univr, unimib, unimi, polimi, polito, unipi, unitorv

\item In the european context: UniLeuven, UniAachen, TUDe, DFKI, SAP se, FG, ESA, CEA, CERN, CNRS, UniCatalunya, UniValencia

\end{itemize}

While this balance may be seen as trivial, it acquires relevance once considering the main modality through which FBK aim to achieve its mission of local development: by connecting the main local innovators to the national and European research network. The nature of research activities greatly influence the business model of research organization, especially for the key partners, and especially at this scale of operations; thus, the largest part of the relationships maintained by these institutions may be expected to be on an international level. 

Fbk istead demonstrated to possess the necessary ambidexterity to handle the research side of its activities at the national and international levels, while managing the national and local relations with firms and other institutions. More interestingly, this balance seems to have emerged autonomously from the daily operations, without the intervention a specific and structured policy. Thus, the natural conclusion is that the organizational climate and culture, autonomously and without the influence of internal and external policy-makers, precisely fit the objectives of the organization, and successfully shaping the daily processes.  

\subsection{Cons}

While the research performance can be evaluated as positive, the first issue that arises from the "analysis" of the FBK's business model is financial in nature, that can be recognize as a threat in a SWOT analysis. This issue can be recognized in the latest "conto economico", which report that on the total 45M income, XXM are provided by the Autonomous Province of Trento (xx\%), the incomes from research grants account for XXM (\%), while industry funds "ammonta" at XX, the XX \%.

While the report "express" a positive balance, it also "rivela" a major issue: the financial dependency on public funds. Taking a neutral perspective on this fact, this dependency arises in fact from the historical luggage of the Foundation, previously a public institution. Following this point of view, the actual situation exhibith a "miglioramento o progresso" from the initial starting point. 

However, FBK truly depends on founds "concessi" from an external actor, instead of "counting" on its internal strengths and market incomes. Without the public funds, the institution will "affrontare" a "great" resize of its organization, both in term of activities and workforce, including a fundamental change in its business model. 

The financial risks embedded in the external dependency could be evaluated through the stability and reliability of the provider, the local government. However, without dig into the evaluation of local institutions and policies, a major observation can be made. in chapter 2 has been described the governmental approach to the universities' administiation, pointing toward a greater responsibilizaiton for their incomes, pushing for the auto-financement and the economic valorization of public-financed research. since this shift in perspectives, how long would it take for the PAT to follow the same path with FBK, and resizing their incomes?

in fact, the shift is already taking place: the public funds decrease from a XX (2000) to XX (2500) to XX (3000). at this point, the safest choice may be to push hard on the research commercialization and auto-financement, anticipating the decrease in external funds, shifting the research orientation toward a more commercial approach rather than being forcebly resized by the lack of funds. In the most long term perspective, the best case scenario may picture FBK as a non-profit organization that makes research for the market, with the positive influence on the local context arising as a positive externalities of its activities, rather than sacrificing economic and financial resources for "getting there now".

This last perspective in fact expose the next issue: the influence of local public institutions on the FBK's mission first and its activities later. remember the two main missions of the Foundation: the scientific excellence (for) a positive impact on the local context, the result of its legacy combined with the newest local policy. perfect fit for a 100\% public institution, but they must be interpretated in the case of an institution that, regardless its form as non-profit, fund, private firm, etc.: a private organization cannot "prescindere" from the economic and financial needs required for its survival in the open market. 

The originial mission pushed FBK to perform both basic research and applied research, with the first primary in importance, dedicated to gain a reputation in the european research network, the last as a secondary or residuary activity. this idea has been mutuated form several interviews inside FBK, with highlighted the perception of employees of the organization: a research organization that works with pure open science - the description of a public institution. 

However, while the old ITC was in fact a public institution that can afford this model, the new FBK is a private organization, that must bear with the economic survival. expecially in the perspective of reducing public funds. therefore, it may be "suggeribile" an additional shift toward a greater orientation to the market, with the aim of increase the industry funds, decrease the dependency on public funds, and evenutally ensuring the survival of the foundation.

The modalities through which implement this shift lead us to the last argument. what, and how, needs to be modified? in the previous section, has been stated how the organization is capable of handle both the research side of its external relationship management, and the industry relationships; however, being capable of does not means that the activities cannot be improved or does not need an improvement. Specifically, if the organization is already capable of, the needed change is incremental rather than disruptive, surely an easier approach.

First, interviews among tto officers highlighted the difficulties in disclosure eliciting and, generally, to gather information on the actual research interests of internal researchers, activities that now relies on the pre-existent network of relationships that an officer have in the organization. two levels of solution are available: the improvement of the organizational culture and the policy enforcement to disclose. a third way involve the restructuring of the tto.

For the organizational culture, the main area is to clarify, even internally, that the organization is not a public research organization that follow exclusively the open science approach. must be clearly communicated that fbk is a private foundation, that perform research for the market, for which the basic reesarch is only a tool for building the knowledge that will be later transferred to the market, and the positive impact on the local context will be the strong but still an "esternalità". 

The starting point for the intervention may be the mission itself. more specific policies instead may involve the obligatoriety of disclosure, i.e. the structuring of an information system that will require, as mandatory, to upload the informations about current research projects to a unique information source, available to tto employees (and eventually to the external industries). More formal moments of exchange between researchers and tto may be institutied.

eventually, can be considered a major change for the tto, expecially the shift toward a decentralized model. this will inlcude the establishment of bridging position in every research unit, which act as a tto representative. being him already into the research unit, the disclosure should be ensured; main tasks should be the structuring of commercial ideas, the management of technical content of ongoing relationships and alike, while taking advantage of the central tto's specialization for legal, marketing and similar works.

the second issue highlighted in interviews is the need for more extensive and useful marketing activities, especially any activity incuded in the seek for customers: market analysis, contacting the potential customer, commercial communication, advertisement and other communication etc. 

the obvious solution is to hire new specialized people. however, this solution is in fact partial: there will be the need to reconfigure a portion of the organizational structure to include and support the efficacy of these new hires. thus, after the institution of these specialized offices, there will be the need for connecting them properly to the organization, especially redesign the process flow internal to the tto to include these activities.

\section{Conclusions}

The discussion of the case study allow us to draw some conclusions. the original topic was: we know a lot on the technology transfer between U and I, as seen in chap 2, 3, 4, and 5. but do something change in a b2b tech transfer? in the 6th chap an attempt has been made to hypotize some differences, which however are purely theoretic for now. in chap 7 however we presented the case of a private research organizaton, which may be publicly-funded but still an organization closer to the market than a university. at the beginning of chap 8, we seen how the case study highlighted some pros and cons, preparing the ground for some conclusion on a larger scale.

\subsection{Organizational mission}

the first idea is that the mission, and its perception, seem to be the most changing and influencing element. it may be sound obvious but it can be further decomposed.

first, we need to consider the various research organizations as distributed on a continuum between the public university totally on an open science approach, and at the other extreme a research organization that works exclusively on commissioned research. obviously, both extremes do not delivery technologies to the market: let alone the university, an organization that perform applied research exclusively when asked have not the ability to build internally a knowledge and technology base that will provide a sustainable competitive base. that is, is it not perform some basic research, tomorrow the firm will not have the knowledge necessary to perform the research asked. a solution may be to continuously hire new people with the new knowledge, but a similar turnover may suggest to catalogue this firm as an intermediary between the researcher and the market, rather than a research organization. moreover, this firm is not the subject of this thesis.

in the continuum between these two extremes, there should be a discrete number of alternatives in organizations that perform research and deliver to the market. two factors should distinguish them the most: the original mission and the organizational structure. therefore, should be expected that the major influencing factor would the mission, the overall objective that dictate the direction and the activities performed internally, while the organizational structure is in fact a "supporting environment" that allow the organization to reach these objectives. 

the case study enrich this perspective. similarly to a public university, fbk has in fact a public aim: the development of the local society and economy. similarly to a fully private research organizaion, the mission is also to deliver new technologies to the market. the original statue seems to put more emphasis in the first mission, therefore the organizational effort in the first is greater. however, taking an historical perspective, the balance of these activities has in fact shift toward a more market-oriented mission, since the transfromation from itc to fbk. 

Considering that in continuum previously stated, there is not a "public mission" and a "private mission", the case study therefore suggests that the mission may assume a discrete number of shades between the two extremis. direct consequence is that may exists a perfect mission that lead the organization to specifically aim to market needs, combined with the minimum basic research required to gain a competitive advantage in the long-term perspective. 

therefore, the factor that differentiate and influence the technology transfer the most between the U-I paradigm and the B2B paradigm may be the organizational mission. the conclusion in this case is that the perspective on basic open scence approach VS the knowledge economy must be revisited to fully understand the impact on the overall approach, thus the mission, in influencing the performance and the competition modality of a private organization. 

a "traccia" for this further research may be the study of TTO's mission statement from author XXX, while usefull insights may be borrowed from studies on knowledge-based and entrepreneurship and its relation with the innovation management.

\subsection{Organizational culture}

secondly, the case study highlighted how, quite surprisingly, the ensemble of researchers and officers inside fbk, aka the organization, seamlessy and emergently adapted to the organizational mission. as previously stated, "nonstante" the presence of organizational policies on the patent channel, or the spinoff channel, they are usually completed by the emergence of organizational practices tacit in nature, surrounded by a network of informal relationships and flows of knowledge, information, suggestions, opinions: the organizational culture.

in this perspective, the organizational culture of private research firms seem very different from the university culture and environment. in chapter 2, we've seen how universities may struggle in pushing an entrepreneurial culture toward a more positive attitude for commercial activities. in the case of a private research organization, it seems to not be a problem at all: given a commercial friendly original mission, fbk demonstrated how in private realities the organizational culture embrace commercial activities and technology transfer. 

obviously, this cultural difference entail a difference in their management: whereas universities may need to undertake heavy and difficult activities for changing the university culture, the private organization will need more subtle, easier, lighter actions. however, while the culture may be already commercial friendly, its development must be governed nevertheless, to use it as an internal positive force while universities may be more occupied in the initial shape shifting initiatives. thus, a change in focus for organizational culture initiatives and management, including obectives and tools slash instruments.

the main implication of this perspective is that the CEO, top management, founder or who-know-what-acronym, has to establish non only a clear and proper mission, compatible with the local firms, innovation system, government etc, but also to place great attention in shaping and orienting the formation and evolution of the organizational culture. the mission set the "fondamenta", policies shape the overall processes and mechanisms, but the factor that do the fine tuning, and eventually determine the final performance for effectiveness and efficiency, seems to be the organizational culture.

implications are that the hr management becomes of primary importance, especially in the selection process of new hires. they must be selected not only on the academic achievements, their crude knowledge, but also, and especially, for other competencies as the attitude toward the market, the ability to recombine previous knowledge (and fields of knowledge) for the benefit of the market, the willingness to work with and for external firms who may commission the research, the ability and willingness to work with colleagues in different fields, to promote an informal, constinuous flow of informations and opinions, ideas, projects. 

a second order implication is the need for the provisioning of proper organizational environment, especially tools, that promote the development of such entrepreneurial culture. in fact, the mission may represent the "final" objective, the organizational structure and the hr base may constitute the "starting point", policies the channels, the limits for the arrow from the basis to the objectives, but the organizational culture does the heavy work. therefore, the need to provide an environment capable of set the boundaries for the autonomous, emergent development of the organizatonal culture, toward a desiderable form.

further research may be needed on the topic. in fact, the organizational culture may borrow some research from the fostering of an entrepreneurial culture in universities, but the aim is not to convince people to engage economic slash commercial activities: in a private organization, they already are (or should be). the focus should be on promoting cross contamination of ideas, informal exchanges, social support and alike. similarly, something can be taken from the literature on the innovation management in a private firm, but again - the need for reconfiguring it from a 100\% industrial climate toward an organization that may be required to perform basic research and undertake, in a limited extent, an open science approach. 

\subsection{Organizational structure}

after the changes in organizational missions and cultures, eventually the organizational structure will be required to follow these new pattern. using the previous metaphor, the mission is the end of the arrow, the culture the starting point and the general tendency toward the ultimate objective, but the force brought in the process from the culture need to be "imbrigliata" toward the specific point pictured as final objective. the best way to do it is to provide an organizational structure that is not only compatible with objectives and culture, efficient and effective, but also able to foster the original force. to direct, and increase the original organizational force. so, what's the differences?

an obvious starting point is the fact that private research organizations do not need an organizational structure for teaching activities, and the structure for basic and long term research may be greatly reduced in respect to the university. however, a research firm will need a greater appied research structure and the commercial structure. in a private environment, an obvious suggestion is to expand the commercial structure far over the tto alone, including marketing and communication, market developer, business developer, attoreys and lawyers.

another important change may be the decentralization of the TTO, by providing an officer in every research unit or center in charge of (1) keeping up with researchers' projects (1a) provide them consulting services on which projects foster etc (2) talk to the central tto (3) seek for possibly interested external firms (4) manage ongoing relations for technical contents. ideally, the central tto should retain only tasks and processes which involve scale economies or technical and specific competences and knowledge, i.e. patent attorneys, contractual aid, marketing etc.

another topic is the hierarchy and the leadership position in the oganizational strucure of research. the leadership must be strong, oriented toward the commercialization, with a overall perspective both on the internal competencies and the external technology trend and market needs. he must also further moments of exchange and cross contamination of ideas, as well as pushing researchers to grow their own projects for tech transfer and propose them to the tto.

within the research organizational structure, however, the performance may take advantage of a fullly flat structure, with researchers "eventualmente" grouped in thematic teams but with "permeabili" bonduaries between them, even with internal mandatory exchange of personnel between functions. may be useful to have a succesful case study, a succesful entrepreneur or alike, in each team.

researachers must also be evaluated through other means than the university environment. indicators may be the number of successful projects active and recently achieved, weighted for relative difficulty, number of proposal to the tto. obviously also the quality of the research. may be useful a 360 degree evaluation, including their boss, colleagues, customers, tto.
